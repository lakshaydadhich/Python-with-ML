Hospital Readmission Prediction Using Random Forest
Tools: Python, Random Forest, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Project Overview:

Developed a machine learning model to predict patient readmission based on historical medical data.
Performed data cleaning, handled missing values, and engineered features from patient data (age, gender, number of procedures, time in hospital, etc.).
Utilized Random Forest to build a robust model that handles both categorical and numerical features, reducing overfitting and improving prediction accuracy.
Achieved insights on feature importance, revealing key factors influencing readmission, such as patient age and number of previous emergency visits.
Visualized readmission patterns using Seaborn and Matplotlib, creating bar charts and plots to analyze gender and age impacts on readmission rates.
Improved the model's performance using cross-validation and evaluation metrics like F1 score and accuracy.
